When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your local?

  When we are collaborating or when I am working in different computers

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	If it updates automatically then it may upload the ones that you may change then. So it is the best if you decide when to sync.
