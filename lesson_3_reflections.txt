When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your local?

  When we are collaborating or when I am working in different computers

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	If it updates automatically then it may upload the ones that you may change then. So it is the best if you decide when to sync.

Decribe the difference between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another? 

	Forks copies between GitHub accounts, clone copies either between local or from GitHub to local.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

	To show that whether we are ahead or behind of the GitHub state

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
	
	If the work is not so much in size, then it may be easier to do without Git, else it is very difficult
